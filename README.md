# Driver-s-drowsiness-detection-system
This project implements a drowsiness detection system using computer vision techniques. The system is designed to monitor a person's eyes and facial expressions in real-time to detect signs of drowsiness, such as eye closure or head nods. It aims to alert the individual when they are becoming drowsy, thereby potentially preventing accidents.
